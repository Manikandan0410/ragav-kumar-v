Object and its internal representation
* In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
Compare it with a cup, for example. 
A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. 
The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
